# ProductConfigurator

This is a small project to show how you can build a product configurator
using Vue JS. I am writing a series of blog posts to accompany the code.

## Part 1

Only a [blog post](https://medium.com/plint-sites/creating-a-product-configurator-with-vue-plint-talk-2808b0ecee59), no code. The post is about the first steps we take before starting to code.

## Part 2

Setup of the project. We use @vue/cli with Vuex. No routing or other packages are involved here for simplicity. The store (with modules) is setup and a simple page is developed to show how the store works. The post covering this is available on [Medium](https://medium.com/plint-sites/creating-a-product-configurator-with-vue-2-2a5d784d684a).

## Part 3

Full implementation of the product configurator with login. The store defined in part 2 is connected to the frontend. You can read the associated blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@pimhooghiemstra/creating-a-product-configurator-with-vue-3-a87985cccaa4).
