# ProductConfigurator

This is a small project to show how you can build a product configurator
using Vue JS. I am writing a series of blog posts to accompany the code.

## Part 1

Only a blog post, no code. The post is about the first steps we take before starting to code.

## Part 2

Setup of the project. We use @vue/cli with Vuex. No routing or other packages are involved here for simplicity. The store (with modules) is setup and a simple page is developed to show how the store works.

## Part 3

To be continued.
